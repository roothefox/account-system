# account-system
# about 
this one is an account creation and viewer program, when you create an account and choose a password, the program hashes it using SHA256, you can share the password all you want but nobody can decode it
to select an option just type the number on startup
number 2 shows you the email, username, hashed password and the randomly generated user_id.
everything will be stored in a json file called accounts.json
i wanted to add a login function but i kept getting errors
here's an example of the .json fil
````
"{\"name\": \"roo\", \"email\": \"roothefoxfurry@gmail.com\", \"password\": \"5370dd32eb303a97abe44c965b430eb222dbd927d8996345c60cbecb98b54091\", \"user_id\": 8808592}"
```
